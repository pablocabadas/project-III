## Introduccion

In order to determine the best cities to establish our video game company, we conducted extensive research and analysis. After careful consideration, we have concluded that San Francisco, Bangalore, and Stockholm are the top choices for us. These cities offer a combination of skilled workforce, thriving startup ecosystems, and supportive government policies, making them ideal locations for our business. In this report, we will provide an overview of our research and explain why we believe these cities are the best options for our company.

San Francisco is a hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship, with Silicon Valley being home to some of the world's biggest technology companies such as Google, Apple, and Facebook. It has a rich ecosystem of venture capitalists, accelerators, and incubators that provide startups with the necessary resources to succeed

Bangalore, on the other hand, is one of the fastest-growing startup hubs in the world. With a population of over 8 million people, Bangalore is home to a large pool of highly skilled tech workers, making it a desirable location for startups seeking talent. 

Lastly, Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden, is one of the most vibrant startup hubs in Europe. The city has a highly educated workforce and a well-established startup ecosystem, with over 18,000 startups operating in the city. Stockholm's startup scene is known for its focus on innovation and sustainability, with a significant number of startups in the fields of clean energy, biotech, and fintech.

## Research

We approached our city selection process by examining which cities have the most successful startups with over $1 million in funding and which ones have the most design companies, as this is an area of interest for some of our employees. After thorough research and analysis, San Francisco emerged as the top choice with 239 startups having raised over $1 million in funding and the presence of just one design companie. We believe that this city's robust startup ecosystem, along with its highly skilled workforce and established infrastructure, make it an ideal location for our video game company.

To that end, we conducted an extensive search for local amenities and attractions in San Francisco. We looked for places such as Starbucks, schools, basketball stadiums, dog grooming services for our furry friend Dobby, party venues, airports, and vegan restaurants.

To make a well-informed decision, we created a heatmap of the top amenities and attractions in each of our chosen cities. This allowed us to visualize which areas had the highest concentration of the things that mattered most to our team, such as Starbucks, schools, basketball stadiums, dog grooming services, party venues, airports, and vegan restaurants. By plotting this information on a map, we could easily see which neighborhoods had the most desirable amenities and attractions.

## Conclusion

Based on our thorough analysis of several factors, including the number of successful startups, the presence of design companies, and the availability of local amenities and attractions. So to find the perfect location for our startup, we utilized various radius within the city of San Francisco to segment and delineate different zones. By doing so, we aimed to identify areas with a higher concentration of relevant features. Our objective was to create a radius of 500 meters as a potential zone for our startup based on the highest number of coincidences.

we generated a heatmap that visually represents the density and distribution of these locations across San Francisco. This heatmap provided valuable insights into the city's characteristics and helped us understand where the demand and activity levels are most prominent.

In addition to the heatmap, we created multiple concentric circles at a specific location, marked by the coordinates [37.7730148, -122.4284791]. Each circle represented a different radius: 2800 meters in yellow, 2100 meters in orange, 1400 meters in blue, and 700 meters in purple. This approach allowed us to analyze and compare the potential zones within the city at various distances from the center point.

After analyzing the data and considering the overlapping areas among the different circles, we discovered two zones that exhibited the highest concentration of coincidences. These zones, located at coordinates [37.764657, -122.426437] and [37.791823, -122.414180], were marked by red circles with a radius of 400 meters. These areas indicate a potential hotspot for our startup, as they offer an optimal combination of favorable factors such as accessibility to important amenities, high activity levels, and potential target customers.

In conclusion, by leveraging our data-driven approach, we have identified and narrowed down the potential areas for our startup's establishment in San Francisco. With a thorough understanding of the city's characteristics and the concentration of relevant features, we have pinpointed a 500-meter radius as a promising zone for further exploration. By focusing our efforts on the zones marked by the red circles with a 400-meter radius, we can maximize our chances of finding an ideal location that aligns with our startup's needs and objectives.
